Tutorials
---------

Each tutorial in this repository is a Jupyter Notebook. Many of the
notebooks have a short video guiding you through the code.
These video tutorials will be available on the sharedrive (and possibly
on Youtube). The tutorial topics and links are listed below.

The aim is to have the topics which were covered in the
`workshops <https://github.com/GuckLab/Python-Workshops/blob/main/workshops>`_
available here in a concise format. See also the related
`resources <https://github.com/GuckLab/Python-Workshops/blob/main/resources>`_.
