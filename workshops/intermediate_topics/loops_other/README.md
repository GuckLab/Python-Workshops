# Loops (other)

- See the `Python-Intermediate-Workshop-Other-Loops.ipynb` notebook for an intro to
  list comprehensions, generator expressions, dict comprehensions, when to use numpy,
  timing notebook cells and tqdm.
- The timing of the loops in the notebook seemed to not be reliable (as the timeit
  module doesn't save variables and other problems), so see the `profiling_loops.py`
  script for profiling the loops mentioned above.
