Intermediate Python Workshops
=============================

The Intermediate Python Workshops are there to help you move from simple python
scripting to using functions and classes, as well as linting and testing your code.

The below topics are one half of the workshops.
The other half is the Mini-Project. The Mini-Project is a project/task that you
want to get done using Python.

The topics we cover are listed below. These might be converted into tutorial videos
on YouTube at some point.

Code Topics covered:
- Functions - Separability and Docstrings
- Classes - abstract classes
  - Structuring modules/package 
- Good clean code - Linting with flake8
- Unit tests - pytest
- Beyond `for` and `while` Loops - list comprehensions and numpy,
  - break, continue try-except
- Virtual Environments - Separating code installations
- Errors - Custom Errors and Warnings
- "Private" and Dunder Variables
- Documentation - API and User Guide Docs with Sphinx
- Checking code speed & optimisation - Benchmarking and Profiling
- Version control - Git basics
- Setting up Python Package
- Setting up CI/CD on GitLab/GitHub

Analysis/Other Topics covered:
 - Image Analysis
 - How to Google things effectively (when to use different websites)


What is an "Intermediate/Advanced" Coder!?
------------------------------------------

There is no definition of "being an intermediate/advanced" coder. However, knowing
some tools can really help you to make your code shareable and ensure it works
outside of your computer (local machine).

Some of these tools are:
- Virtual Environments
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - standard python layout according to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) - Test your python code in a simple way.
- [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) - Create automated and USer Guide documentation describing your code.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Python 3.10 installed (or at least 3.6)
- Know how to run code with the terminal, IDE, and via the Python Console

Running the notebooks (branch `add_intermediate_workshops`)
