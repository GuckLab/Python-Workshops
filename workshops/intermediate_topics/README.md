# Intermediate Python Workshops

The Intermediate Python Workshops are there to help you move from simple python
scripting to using functions and classes, as well as linting and testing your code.
The topics we cover are listed below. These might be converted into tutorial videos
on YouTube at some point.

Code Topics covered:
 - "Private" and Dunder Variables
 - Errors - Custom Errors and Warnings
 - Functions - Separability and Docstrings
 - Classes
 - Good clean code - Linting with flake8
 - Unit tests - pytest
 - Documentation - API and User Guide Docs with Sphinx
 - Beyond `for` and `while` Loops - list comprehensions and numpy
 - Virtual Environments - Separating code installations
 - Version control - Git
 - Checking code speed & optimisation - Benchmarking and Profiling

Analysis Topics covered:
 - Image Analysis
 - other

## What is an "Intermediate/Advanced" Coder!?

There is no definition of "being an intermediate/advanced" coder. However, knowing
some tools can really help you to make your code shareable and ensure it works
outside of your computer (local machine).

Some of these tools are:
- Virtual Environments
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - standard python layout according to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) - Test your python code in a simple way.
- [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) - Create automated and USer Guide documentation describing your code.
